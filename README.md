# Stock Market Data

This project is a Python-based command-line app designed to fetch, save, and analyze stock market data from two major providers: **Yahoo Finance** and **AlphaVantage**. It was created as a learning project to demonstrate skills in Python programming, working with APIs, and data visualization.

---

## **What This App Does**

- Lets users choose between Yahoo Finance and AlphaVantage to fetch stock market data.
- Allows input for specific stock symbols, date ranges, and time intervals.
- Saves the fetched data in CSV format for later use.
- Displays visualizations of stock performance, such as closing prices over time.

## **How to Use It**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/stock-market-app.git
   cd stock-market-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts:
   - Choose a data provider (Yahoo Finance or AlphaVantage).
   - Enter a stock symbol from the list.
   - Provide additional inputs, such as date range and interval (as applicable).

## **Things I Learned**

1. How to integrate multiple APIs into a single project.
2. Using `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` for visualization.
3. Writing modular code for better maintainability.
4. Error handling to improve user experience.

## **Whatâ€™s Next?**

- Add dynamic stock symbol loading from APIs.
- Implement comparison features for multiple stocks or providers.
- Create a simple GUI using a framework like Tkinter.
